What is SCP ??

scp (secure copy ) is command in linux to copy files between servers in secure way and between local host and remote host.

COPYING FROM MACHINE TO EC2 INSTANCE

scp -i <pem file> <file_to_copy_from_local> ec2-user@<ip_address>:<location_in_the_instance>
ex:
sudo scp -i 1st_keypair.pem 1st_keypair.pem ec2-user@ec2-43-205-120-21.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com:/home/ec2-user

COPY FROM EC2 INSTANCE TO LOCAL MACHINE

scp -i <pem_file> ec2-user@<ip_address>:<file_to_copy_from_instance> <destination_in_local>

GIT COMMANDS#
############

what is diff between git and gitHb??
what is difference between repository and branch in git?
what is difference between git Push and Git pull?
what is difference between git pull and git fetch command?

The Git Fetch command is used to fetch all changes from the remote repository to the local repository. It doesn’t make any changes to the current working directory.
It stores all the changes in a separate branch called the remote-tracking branch. git merge or git rebase command is used to merge these changes into our current working directory.
How to Use Git Fetch?
Step 1: Let us create a file called demo.txt with “Hello Geeks” content inside it initialize the directory to a git repository and push the changes to a remote repository.

git init
git add <Filename>
git commit -m <Commit Message>
git remote add origin <Link to your remote repository>
git push origin <branch name>
Now, we have my demo.txt in the remote repository. 
The local and the remote repositories are now in sync and have the same content at both places. Let’s now update our demo.txt in the remote repository. 
Step 2: We will update our demo.txt remotely.
Now since we have updated our demo.txt remotely, let’s bring the changes to our local repository. Our local repository has only 1 commit while the remote repository now has 2 commits.
Step 3: Let’s use the git fetch command to see in the local repository whether we have a change in the remote repository or not. Before that let’s use the git log command to see our previous commits.
We can see that after using git fetch we get the information that there is some commit done in the remote repository.
Step 4: To merge these changes into our local repository, we need to use the git merge origin/<branch name> command. 

What is Git Pull?
Git Pull command is used to fetch all changes from the remote repository to the current working directory. It automatically try to merge or rebase them into our current working directory. It is the combination of git fetch and git merge or git rebase. It can generate merge conflicts if there are conflict changes between our local and remote branches.
git pull = git fetch + git merge

what is difference between git clone and git remote?
what is difference between git diff and git status?
what is difference between git merge and git rebase?
how can you fix broken commit?
what happens when .git directory deleted?
what is difference between staging area and Indexing ?
what does the command git config do?



to keep track all the changes of each file manually it is not possible so will go with VCS(version controll system)

GIT : git is local repo To keep track of all the changes and commit done we use GIT

GITHUB: GitHub is a remote repo ... web-based Git repository where you ca push all the changes and commit which you have done.

to install git>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

yum install git -y 


to check the modification you need to setup global parameter.

1. git config --global user.name "name"
2. git config --global user.email "email" 


to check the global parameter 

3. git config --list

to initialize 

4. git init

now check status 

5. git status

now for example creation one file 

7. vim test.java

 now again check the status  

8. git status( TO CHECK WHAT IS THE STATUS OF MY WORKING AREA )
---------------------------------------------------------------
|Working area   | cache/Stage area    | local remote area      |                   
|               |                     |                        |
|               |                     |                        |
|# git status   |# git add <file name>| # git commit -m "abc"  |
|               |                     |                        |
|               |                     |                        |

IN GIT 3 AREA WILL BE THERE 
1. WORKING AREA : Where you will write your program or code 
2. CACHE AREA/ STAGED AREA :  If you want to track the changes which you have done you need to add into staged area ( git add < file name > )
3. LOCAL REPO AREA: If you want to upload final version of code into local repo git ( git commit -m " commit messages " )

git add < file name >  

git commit -m " messages for commit "
 
to check the commit status >>>>>>>>>>>>>
git log

NEGATIVE CASES:
CASE 1:
if you want to discart the changes whatever you have done in working area then >>>>>>>>>>>>>

git restore < file name > ( discart the changes from working area ) 

CASE 2:
if we added changes using git add then 
git remote --staged     ( remove from cache area )

CASE 3:

if we added changes to staging area (didn't commit) and again we done some changes in staging area and that staging file
is ready to commit and ready to add 

git restore --worktree <file name>    (restore the changes form staging area )

CASE 4:
if we did commit wrong files

Git reset moves the branch pointer to a different commit, affecting the branch's history.

git reset --soft HEAD^  (go back to 1 previous commit with deleting changes....it will undo the changes and will go back to staging area )
git reset --hard HEAD^ (go back to 1 previous commit with deleting all changes....it will undo the changes and deleting all the all the changes and commit )

Git revert creates a new commit to undo changes while preserving history

if you want to check latest changes previous version of the file >>>>>>>>>>

git diff < commit id of firt version > .. < commit if od second version >



How to filter log >>>>>>

git log --oneline


git log --since yyyy-mm-dd  ( check commit from last week or month ) 

git log --until yyyy-mm-dd   ( check commit till perticular date )

git log --since yyyy-mm-dd --oneline


git log --since yyyy-mm-dd --until yyyy-mm-dd 

git log --since yyyy-mm-dd --auther " vishwa.d "  ( check the log from perticular date for perticular auther vishwa.d ) 

git log -5 ( check first 5 line )




How to ignore the file >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

if you clone the repo and all type of file is available on the same directory like (.PYTHON .TXT  .NET  .JAVA)


if it is (.java) then track it and ignore all other file >>>>>>>>>

then you have to create one hidden file ( .gitignore ) 


vim .gitignore

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
|*.py   
|*.txt  
|*.net
|!one.net  ( even though .net is ignore but trach this perticular file )
|[aeiou]*.py { ignore the python file start with (aeiou) }
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

then do git add .
git commit -m "abc " 

 
How to rename the file in git >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

git mv < old file name > < new file name >


HOW TO RESOLVE THE BUG ERROR ISSUE 

step 1 >>>>>> Make a copy of existing code by creating new branch ( just create new branch your code will autometically copied )  

step 2 >>>>>> fix the copy of the code ( jump into the new branch and do the changes and commit )

step 3 >>>>>> test the copy code 

step 4 >>>>>  merge the code with master 

git branch < new branch name > ( to create the new branch or copy the master branch )

git branch ( to view branch )

git diff < master branch > .. < new branch name >



How to jump inside new branch >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

git checkout < new branch name >

Now merge with master branch >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

So hear <master> branch is the target branch and < newly created branch > is the source branch ( bug 1)

git checkout master 


git merge bug 1 ( hear bug 1 is the newly created branch )



How to rename the branch ????>>>>>>>>>>.

git branch -m < old branch name > < new branch name >



How to delete the branch ????????>>>>>>>>>>.

Before deleting branch you must go out of the branch then do delete 

git branch -d < branch name >



HOW TO DOWNLOAD THE CONTANT FROM REMOTE ??

two ways to download the contant 1.first fetch then merge  2. pull


Before download the contant from remote you need to check and establish communication between remote and local repo.          


git remote ( to check is there any communication from remote or not )

git remote -v ( details about remote repo )    

to add remote repo  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

git remote add origin < url >

After adding remote repo you can fetch and push the code if you check ( git remote -v )

git fetch    ( the moment you enter git fetch then the file will not directly add to local repo the file will come under local remote repo so

               you need to merge the file )

git checkout < target branch >  ( before merge you have to be in target branch )

git merge < source branch name > ( now you are already in target branch so just merge with source branch )


If you want to upload/Push the file from local repo to remote repo >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>


git push -u origin master 


if you want to clone the file 

git clone < url > 

=================================================================================================================================================================================

for maven project

1- first check java is installed or not and if not the use below command:

yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel

2- downloads maven binary file from apache maven official doc.example given below:
				
wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/maven/maven-3/3.9.2/binaries/apache-maven-3.9.2-bin.tar.gz

3- now you have to untar the file under any foler and copy untar file under any folder but hear we are using /opt folder:

tar -xvzf apache-maven-3.9.2-bin.tar.gz -C /opt

4- now you have to set the environment and path 

export M2_HOME=/opt/apache-maven-3.9.2

chk env also if you wantby (#env) command

export PATH=$PATH:$M2_HOME/bin

----------------------------------
now mvn ready to use you can check mvn version

mvn --version

now you can use project structure given by manven by below given command:

mvn archetype:generate

you can create sample JAR project structure

www.cloudbots.com

then build the file using below command :

before compile you can validate alos
mvn validate

if validate success go for build 

mvn compile
mvn test
mvn package

you can check maven local repo

cd ~/.M2
do long list (ll) and check


IF you want to Run jar file the use below 

(java -cp target/cloudboats_jarproj-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.cloudboats.www.App)

=========================================================================================================================================================================================


FOR TOMCAT

1- check java is install or not if not then install 

yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel

2- download tomcat by binary method 

wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-8/v8.5.89/bin/apache-tomcat-8.5.89.tar.gz

3- you have to untar and copy under /opt folder 

tar -xvzf apache-tomcat-8.5.89.tar.gz -C /opt

4- tomcat is 3rd pary tool you can create user to use it and give admin previlage for same user

useradd tomcat

add password for same user 
passwd tomcat


if you required to change ownership of tomcat then change it

chown -R tomcat:tomcat/opt/apache-tomcat-8.5.89

now login as tomcat user with below command:

#su - tomcat

now you have to change some configuration under XML file to run tomcat application.

open XML file under config folder i.e "/opt/apache-tomcat-8.5.89/conf"

before do any changes copy XML file under same folder for any diff folder

#cp tomcat-user.XML tomcat-user.XML.bkp

now open XML file and add Role , username and  password.
----------------------------------------------------------------
By default, no user is included in the "manager-gui" role required
  to operate the "/manager/html" web application.  If you wish to use this app,
  you must define such a user - the username and password are arbitrary.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<tomcat-users>
  <role rolename="manager-gui"/>
  <user username="tomcatmgr" password="tomcatmgr" roles="manager-gui"/>
  <role rolename="manager-script"/>
  <user username="deploy" password="deploy" roles="manager-script"/>
</tomcat-users>
------------------------------------------------------------------
 
now restart the tomcat application 
 
# cd /opt/apache-tomcat-8.5.89/bin
./startup.sh
./shutdown.sh
./startup.sh

now open http://<host public ip>:8080

now after deployment WAR file if you want to run the file then  you have to allow your tomcat to access from any machine uner "CATALINA_BASE"


Go to #cd /opt/apache-tomcat-8.5.89/conf/Catalina/localhost

then create one manager.xml file and use below command:
<Context privileged="true" antiResourceLocking="false"
          docBase="${catalina.home}/webapps/manager">
          <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve" allow="^.*$" />
        </Context>

now again if you want to restart tomcat web application so you can restart.

# cd /opt/apache-tomcat-8.5.89/bin
./startup.sh
./shutdown.sh
./startup.sh

#####################################

It is a integration and deploynment tool which help to integrate every environment tool in your project 



if tomacat already install in then login as tomcat user 

su - tomcat 

wget https://get.jenkins.io/war-stable/2.346.1/jenkins.war 

now copy jenkin.war into webapps folder 

cp jenkin.war /opt/apache-tomcat-8.5.89/webapps

now open jenkin.war file 

install jenking with suggested plugin and finish 


how to install plugins in jenkins

>>>>>> MAVEN INTEGRATION for maven 
>>>>>> from  global configuration tool configure the maven plugin and set HOME_PATH 
NAME :  MAVEN_HOME
PATH : /opt/apache-maven-3.9.1 

and save it for maven integration 

now you can create

COMPILE JOB
TEST JOB 
PACKAGE JOB


IF YOU WANT TO RUN ALL JOB IN SEQUENCE THEN SELECT THE OPTION 

" Build after another project are build "

IF YOU WANT TO VIEW ALL JOB IN PIPELINE VIEW THEN INSTALL PLUGIN CALLED AS 

" Build pipeline "

After package job done and if you want to deploy your WAR file into the TOMCAT then 

need to download  " DEPLOY TO CONTAINER " plugin


for master slave configuration follow below steps>>>>>>>>>>>>
- first make sure java installed and version should be same as master server
- generate ssh-keygen and copy public key to slave machine unter .ssh/authorizedkey
- copy private key and save in jenkins credentials 
- we have to give slave server public IP address to jenkins
